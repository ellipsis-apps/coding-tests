## What this repo holds...

This repo will hold sample code for coding tests I've participated in.

## Tests
The first test is in the "CurrencyTest" folder. The readme.md file there describes the requirements given. There is only one solution there at the moment (10/20/2025). It is in the MudBlazorVersion folder. It is a Blazor PWA standalone app that uses the MudBlazor (https://mudblazor.com/) set of components. I'll add new versions based on for comparison purposes.
- other blazor component libraries
- other frameworks (React, Angular)
